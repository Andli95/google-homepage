This is my first real practice with in the odinproject. I am going to build a google homepage using dev-tool, should be a great help. 

Once i have completed this project i should be more familiar with
    1. Using github.
    2. Seting up a basic website
    3. Structure a HTML file
    4.structure a css file.
    5. Using devtools.
